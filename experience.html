          <h5>
            From university group projects, to volunteering as a gymnastics
            coach, to extracurricular leadership experiences, I am well-versed
            in collaborating in a team. <br /><br />
            In a team setting, I bring energy and enthusiasm to all, creating an
            exciting work environment. In most cases, I act as the ringleader,
            such as founding my university's Game Development Club, leading a
            15-member indie team, and directing my first hackathon project. I
            can also fit in assisting roles, such as acting as a Client Lead,
            recruiting companies and businesses as clients for for FLUI, Emily
            Carr's premier design hackathon.

            Members of Studi6, an indie game development team I am currently
            leading. We had just come back from Karaoke and skating as a fun
            team-bonding activity.

            I am leading a team of 15 members in the creation of Arcaemi, a
            bullet-hell dating simulator game in association with the UBC Game
            Development Club. I joined the team roughly two months into
            development, and have significantly accelerated the progress since
            assuming leadership. I am responsible for organizing and planning
            meetings and making vital design decisions aligning with the team's
            vision. I also assign work to members based on their individual
            strengths.

        <h5>
          Self-guided passion project. Black Forest Cafe is a Roguelite
          Restaurant adventure with procedurally generated dungeons and
          fast-paced combat created with Unity. All aspects of game creation,
          including pixel art, programming in C#, and design were taught and
          done solely by myself. Everything present was created and learned in
          two months.<br />

          <br />My goal was ambitious but unrealistic: I wanted it to be the
          perfect procedurally-generated coop adventure you could play with your
          sibling on a Friday night, yet lacked even the basics of game
          development. I had no experience in C#, Unity, or game design, yet
          this did not deter my efforts. Over the next two months, I slogged
          through numerous hours of YouTube tutorials, documentation-reading,
          and Chat-GPT prompting.<br /><br />
          Despite its challenges, the learning process was addicting, providing
          a little victory every time a new feature was implemented, such as an
          inventory system, enemy pathfinding, and depth-based procedural
          generation. As I persevered, my understanding of Unity exponentially
          improved, constantly rewriting and restructuring my code more
          efficiently. My success has motivated me to expand my self-taught
          skills in a perpetual pursuit of knowledge.

        <h2>THE FIRST DAY</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          Despite having no experience in C#, my knowledge of C++ applied to its
          base concepts, allowing me to learn its syntax quickly and create a
          lot of scripts. Additionally, my work in general was extremely fast,
          solely driven by my passion for game development. My assets were
          created through Photoshop, while my code was learned through YouTube
          tutorials and logic. Within the first day of working on the project, I
          created the following:
          <br /><br />
          Player sprite <br />Animated walking sprites<br />Tilesets<br />Entity
          shadow system <br />Sprite atlas

        <h2>PROCEDURAL GENERATION</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          The entire third day was dedicated to learning how to procedurally
          generate a dungeon and implementing it into the game. I used a mix of
          random walk generation, scriptable objects for room presets, and a
          rudimentary form of a binary tree to record dungeon depth while also
          guaranteeing a fair layout.

        <h2>ITEMS AND ENEMIES</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          The next week consisted of implementing the following features:
          <br />
          <br />
          Item generator script
          <br />
          Sprites of necklaces, barrels, and treasure chests
          <br />
          Interactable treasure chest
          <br />
          Different floor tiles generator
          <br />
          'Nearest' script that checks for nearest tagged objects to origin
          position
          <br />
          Auto attack <br />
          Included barrels into auto attack

        </span>
        <h2>INVENTORY SYSTEM</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          I began working on the inventory system over the next week after I
          compeleted my randomized drop script. However, I underestimated how
          difficult it would be. An overlooked pointer issue caused significant
          issues for me, triggering a frustrating memory leak and all items to
          be added in the same place.

        <h5>
          I was finally able to fix it because my more experienced friend
          noticed I wasn't creating a new instance of item, an apparently common
          problem among his peers. I was really relieved with his help since I
          felt like I checked everything in my scripts and still couldn't solve
          the issue. It still set me back more time than I would've liked.

        <h2>COMBAT TWEAKS</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          I added a new enemy and a distinction between the two types: ranged
          and melee. I also added a damage flash upon the enemy getting hit.
          This feature was also surprisingly frustrating to implement, because
          the default colour "White" in Unity just renders the sprite in its
          original colour. I had to develop my own materials and shaders in
          order to solve the problem.

        <div id="video-container">

          ></iframe>
        </div>
        <h5>
          The new enemy was a purple bat. I reused a bit of the other projectile
          code but had to change the aggro system since the animations always
          played in sync. The main way I solved this was creating group aggro,
          where I would assign each entity a number when generated and reference
          the number from the list to trigger the aggro. Unfortunately, I didn't
          develop the animation stagger in the video.

          This game design document is the culmination of two months of
          dedicated work and design. It contains the basic concept, key
          features, procedural generation algorithms, and art direction
          document. Additionally, you can view the Devlogs linked below. It
          contains all the recorded progress and problems I ran into during
          production.

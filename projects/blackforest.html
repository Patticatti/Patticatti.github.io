        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          Self-guided passion project. Black Forest Cafe is a Roguelite
          Restaurant adventure with procedurally generated dungeons and
          fast-paced combat created with Unity. All aspects of game creation,
          including pixel art, programming in C#, and design were taught and
          done solely by myself. My goal was ambitious but unrealistic: I wanted
          it to be the perfect procedurally-generated coop adventure you could
          play with your sibling on a Friday night, yet lacked even the basics
          of game development. I had no experience in C#, Unity, or game design,
          yet this did not deter my efforts. Over the next two months, I slogged
          through numerous hours of YouTube tutorials, documentation-reading,
          and Chat-GPT prompting.

        <h5>
          This game design document is the culmination of two months of
          dedicated work and design. It contains the basic concept, key
          features, procedural generation algorithms, and art direction
          document. Additionally, you can view the Devlogs linked below. It
          contains all the recorded progress and problems I ran into during
          production.

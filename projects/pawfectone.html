        <h2>PAWFECT ONE</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          Awarded Top 5 Finalist out of 250 participants for my first hackathon,
          nwPlus' HackCamp 2023, a 12-hour hackathon. Pawfect One is an
          innovative dating app for dog owners, designed to connect dog owners
          in their quest for companionship â€“ both for themselves and their furry
          friends. It is based off the stereotype of how dog owners tend to look
          and act like their dogs. Users swipe through profiles, to find a
          compatible dog that matches with their personality. Upon a match, the
          dog's profile is revealed, along with its owner's information.
          <br /><br />As a Project Manager and UX/UI Designer for Pawfect One, I
          was responsible for the website UX/UI design, wireframing, prototype,
          visual graphics, mood board, and video editing. All work seen on this
          page was completed in the span of 12 hours.

        <h2>THE MAIN CHALLENGE</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          Our team was predominantly composed of first-time hackers with little
          to no knowledge on web development or design. We were a rag-tag team
          of four strangers, and unlike premade teams, did not have a preplanned
          idea concept. We were tasked with developing a working app within 12
          hours, making it difficult to learn while balancing build time.
        </h5>
        <h2>LEARN DAY</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          Learn Day was the first phase of the hackathon. It was a day dedicated
          to learning new skills from presentations and workshops. Attendance
          was optional, but I came as early as I could to have adequate time to
          plan out our design. The day was mostly dedicated to getting myself
          acquainted with my three teammates, discussing our idea and design
          scope, as well as addressing possible problems that we might face.

        <h2>MOODBOARD</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          We decided to first create a moodboard to serve as inspiration for our
          app. I downloaded a bunch of different dating apps, taking screenshots
          and recording my interactions with the UI for animations and logic.
          From there, I compiled them into a master moodboard, making sure to
          gather input and feedback from my teammates. Additionally, I
          researched possible colour palettes which aligned with our team's
          design goals, which was to make an adorable 'kawaii' aesthetic app.
          However, we would end up doing a website, but this still was useful in
          terms of content placement.

        <h5>
          Due to the nature of the hackathon, we weren't allowed to create
          anything else before Build Day, so our moodboard was the only
          reference material we had going in to the competition.
        </h5>
        <h2>BUILD DAY</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          Build Day was the 12-hour window where we could bring our project to
          life. During this period, I created the wireframes, Figma prototype,
          taught my teammate Figma, added the animations and transitions,
          created the graphics in Illustrator, and editted the presentation
          video with Premier Pro.

        <h2>CHECKLIST AND DOCUMENTATION</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          Ivan and I created a checklist from what we discussed on Learn Day.
          Featured in the checklist is necessary features for our prototype. I
          made sure to include these when making my wireframes. We set a time
          buffer of 2 hours before the deadline to finish, so that we wouldn't
          be rushed in submitting the project.

        ></iframe>
        <h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          The next step was making wireframes for key screens. Since we only had
          12 hours to create the entire design, I opted for the fewest key
          screens so we could maximize their quality. Also on the sheet were
          iterations of the logo prototypes and graphic layouts which I would
          have to create in Illustrator.

        <h2>GRAPHICS AND ASSETS</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          Next, I opted to make custom graphic assets for the logo, landing, and
          page UI using a mix of Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I wasn't sure
          about usage rights for our project, so I decided to play it safe by
          making everything myself.

        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />

          Now came the building of the real website UI. I based the screen
          designs off of the wireframes, changing and improving some features on
          the fly. Together, my teammate and I collaborated in creating the
          screens and adapting the designs in Figma.

          Above is our peer feedback for our project. I was glad to see so many
          people praising our UI and frontend designs. I believe the extra
          attention and time we dedicated to polishing the UI really helped our
          project to stand out.

        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          To our surprise, we won a Finalist prize! Nothing can describe the
          elation I felt in the moment, seeing our project's name displayed on
          the big screen. I felt as though our persistent efforts truly had been
          worth it. Most of all, I was very happy that our determination to make
          a fully interactive Figma prototype served proof that hard work does
          pay off.
          <br /><br />
          In short, I learned that it is best when you take the time to teach
          others. Secondly, that I should always express my highest efforts for
          everything in life, and that collaboration is key to success.

          Awarded Top 5 Finalist out of 250 participants for my first hackathon,
          nwPlus' HackCamp 2023. Acted as Project Manager and Lead Frontend
          Designer for Pawfect One, an innovative dating app for dog owners. I
          was responsible for all website UI design, wireframing, prototype,
          visual graphics, mood board, and video editing. Pawfect One is an
          application designed to connect dog owners in their quest for
          companionship â€“ both for themselves and their furry friends. Users
          navigate through profiles, much like a dating app, to find a
          compatible dog that aligns with their own and sparks interest. Upon a
          match, the dog's profile is revealed, along with its owner's
          information.

        <h2>MOODBOARD</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          The first step to the design process was creating a moodboard. I
          downloaded at least 5 different dating apps and took screenshots of
          their individual screens. From there, I compiled them into a master
          moodboard, collecting input from my teammates. Additionally, I
          researched possible colour palettes which aligned with our team's
          design goals. I also searched up cute mobile app inspiration. However,
          we would end up doing a website, but this still was useful in terms of
          content placement.

        <h5>
          Sailorsana is a fictional Sports Community themed around sustainable
          living. This project just consists of a landing page which I designed
          and developed in just 2 days.

        <h2>LOGO</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          I made the logo in Adobe Illustrator. The logo was surprisingly
          difficult to design since I was torn between two styles: the typical
          Varsity sports logo style that I normally associate with sports, or
          something that felt more modern and aligned with the theme of
          sustainable living. Here are some of the drafts I made:

        <h2>REFERENCES</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          The first step of the process was creating a huge mood board to get as
          many references for the website as possible for a competitor analysis.
          I gathered references for sustainable living and eco-friendly styles.
          However, I initially wasn't a fan of using green, due to its passive
          connotations which wouldn't make a good sports team colour.

        <h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          The key features that I wanted to have were a clear header, title
          page, top stories, calendar/schedule, videos, photos, social media,
          and footer. I noticed these were the most frequent staples of each
          sport's team website. I then designed a few wireframes with this in
          mind. I really wanted to include the calendar on the landing due to
          how important it is for the user to view.

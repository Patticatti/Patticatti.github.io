        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          Star Crossed, formerly known as Arcaemi, is an upcoming and unique
          Bullet-Hell Dating sim currently in production by Studi6 since
          September 2023. It is an innovative fusion of Sci-Fi and Eldritch
          Horror, set in a mysterious post-apocalyptic planet. I lead our team
          which consists of 15 highly passionate members, with a single
          individual assigned to oversee each aspect of game production: Art,
          Programming, Design, Writing, and Music.

        <h2>GAMEPLAY SUMMARY</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          You crash land on this planet called Arcaemi, creating a huge crater
          and ending up deep below the planet's surface. Now, you begin carrying
          your ship, piece by piece, to the surface to fix it and leave the
          planet. At each level you climb, there is a Guardian of the Old One
          who wants to stop you. You can either talk them out of fighting and
          onto your side (maybe even flirt with them…), or kill them!

        <h2>INSPIRATION</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          In H.P Lovecraft mythos, there is a planet called “Yuggoth” that the
          Old One is from. This is what we are basing Star Crossed off of. We
          want to go for a more scientific approach to magic, like
          technomagical.

        <h2>ART</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          We have decided on a 2D Pixel art style with a theme of finding beauty
          in the terrifying and mysterious unknown. To begin our process, we
          created an artboard with all our references and artwork.

        <h2>CHARACTER DESIGN</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          Our main protagonists consist of Deuce, a swanky and witty scavenger
          with loose morals, and Marija, an ex-military technician who is also
          Deuce's sister. Seen below is their character design from Arthur, our
          Lead Artist.

        <h2>BOSS DESIGN</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          As the main pinnacle and draw of our game, each boss has been
          carefully designed to seductively appeal to all tastes. Below are more
          concepts from Arthur.

        <h2>ENEMY DESIGN</h2>
        <img class="horizline" src="../images/horizline.svg" />
        <h5>
          Enemies populate the levels of Arcaemi, acting as individual
          challenges the player must defeat. Some possess twisted appearances
          corrupted by the Old One, while others are grotesque fusions of
          cybernetics and organic matter.

        <h2>MY TEAM ROLE</h2>

        <h5>
          As the leader of Studi6, I act as the "team mom" to guide production
          while supporting each team member's vision. Since most members are new
          to game development, I provide insightful solutions to challenges and
          educated feedback with my comprehensive experience. My most important
          goal is to create a fun and enthusiastic environment for the team,
          organizing team-building events, hangouts, and in-person brainstorming
          sessions.
